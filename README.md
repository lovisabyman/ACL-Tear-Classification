In this project the impact of a reduced feature space on deep-learning-assisted diagnosis for knee MRIs was evaluated. This project was done as a part of the course CS 235: Computational Methods for Biomedical Image Analysis and Interpretation at Stanford University by Lovisa Byman, Katelyn K. Bechler, Shreya Narayan and Asha Thomas.


The dataset used in this project was the MRNet dataset [1] and the method used was also largely based on the article Deep-learning-assisted diagnosis for knee magnetic resonance imaging: Development and retrospective validation of MRNet [1]. The code for the project was to a large extent based on the code by Neergaard [2].
